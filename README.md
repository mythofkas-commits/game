**Important Notes** (verbatim):  
```

Order Matters: Add classes BEFORE PresidentGame
Constructor: Must initialize inbox in constructor
Methods: Must replace showNotification & createPublicOpinionBattle
CSS: Must add ALL styles (donâ€™t skip any)

**Quick Troubleshooting** (verbatim):  
```

No inbox icon -> Check constructor initialization
Notifications not saving -> Check browser localStorage
Battles not appearing -> Add class & replace createPublicOpinionBattle
Console errors -> Paste CSS, check for conflicts
